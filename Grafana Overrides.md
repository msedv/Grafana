We have a bunch of sensors (e.g. 25-30 ESPs running Tasmota) sending different measurements to MQTT - Influx - Grafana; works real nice. In the legend in the moment the ID of the devices is displayed:

My end users would like to see a more human readable description like "machine x/hall y" instead of "DF6B09". Of course I could to the lookup on the import side but that would store a lot of redundant text for millions of measurements and arises problems if one of the descriptions will change (which for sure will be happenâ€¦).

In the [Grafana community](https://community.grafana.com/t/lookup-of-device-ids-for-legend/60401) Grant Pinkos made the suggestion to use overlays to get a more descriptive legend.

On the options tab right of the graph per default "All" is selected:

Switching to "Overrides":

allows us to add a field override; we choose "Fields with name":

Select the field which should be replaced:

We want to change the display name (hint: typing "dis" reduces the many possible options):

And give it a nice description:

![GrafanaOverrides8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7942032/153693936-c69939e2-6737-43a3-9ad7-7ce99f411c24.png)

A view other overrides:

And the result:

Of course it would be a real burden to do that manually in many dashboards/panels for dozens of sensors - particularly because I could to all the mappings automatically. So I digged "a little bit" into the Grafanas data structures and made a [proof of concept ython-script](https://github.com/msedv/Grafana/blob/main/parsegrafana.py) which I could/would extend to automize the process of defining the overrides.
